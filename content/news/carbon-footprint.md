You know we’ve been working hard since the launch of Paradise City on making it a green event. **_Sustainability_** and our **_ecological impact_** have always been at the core of Paradise City DNA. It has always demanded a lot of sweat and tears from our team, volunteers and suppliers. Goal achieved this year as we’ve been elected as **_1 of the 6 greenest festivals_** in the world by A Greener Festival. As a not-for-profit, they are committed to help festivals adopt environmentally efficient practices. They visited participating festivals and evaluated them thoroughly on topics such as **_transport_**, **_power_**, **_water management_**, **_carbon analysis_** and more.

We're very proud with this award. People make the party, but people also keep the festival green so, **_we have you_**, our dearest citizens, to thank for this fantastic achievement**_._**
