For campers, Paradise City is more than a music festival, it is also a camping experience. Along with a rising sunshine and star-lit night skies, the intimate setting welcomes a fantastic crowd of music lovers.

Our camping will be your personal chill-out area in the midst of festival insanity. There are different options to stay onsite:

* You can bring your own tent and camping equipment by buying a **3 days-ticket + camping** or by buying a **basic ticket for the camping** for 35€.
* You can make your festival weekend easier and buy a package which includes a tent, sleeping bags, mattress and chairs. Everything is provided by **Camp2Camp**. Prices vary from 75€ to 220€, depending on how many people you are (1, 2 or 4).
* For those who wish something different and want to add some style, comfort and fun to their festival experience, there are the **glamping options**: shiny tents for 2, 4 or 5 persons with cosy beds, electricity and light.
* **Campers** and **caravans** can be parked in the Camper area with a separate ticket for **40€**. Water and electricity will be supplied for your campers on the caravan pitch.
