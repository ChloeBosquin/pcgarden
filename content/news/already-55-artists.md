The Belgian brothers **2manydjs** are back for the second time in a row, this time they will close the festival on Sunday. For the fans of the downtempo and blissful vibes, **Acid Pauli** is not to miss during the sunset. 

**Hunee** will bless the audience with a 3-hour set of soul infused house and **Mr. G** will deliver a special performance for true music fans appreciating his vast contribution to dance music.

Paradise City likes to bring young and fresh acts to their green grass  
like the Irish DJ **Or:la** and wants to contribute to the comeback of live music with the one-man-band, piano phenomenon **Mezerg**. 

The full line-up will be announced on March 25th!
