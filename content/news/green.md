Global emissions keep beating records every year. The environmental crisis dawning upon us means that we all need to adapt fast and efficiently. The music industry needs to focus on this topic too. Since day one, sustainability sits at the core of Paradise City’s DNA. It implies taking into consideration various aspects regarding its organisation and its process. Paradise City is a meat-free and a no-single-use plastic festival. We not only recycle but we re-use everything we can.

Like each year, we’ll take additional steps to lower our ecological footprint.

But let’s focus on what happened last year: we’ve decreased our CO2 emissions. Our **_footprint per visitor_** has decreased by **_4%_** from last year - taking into account that we added a fourth stage and that the camping grew by 40%. But also, you’re helping us getting one step closer to a carbon neutral event by **_eating unsold food_** from Delhaize on the festival site. And last but not least: **_17%_** of Paradise citizens used **_public transport_**, compared to 7% two years ago.

We know we can do better but there’s **_substantial improvement_**. We promise to continue doing our best efforts to implement more ecologically mindful ways to enjoy Paradise City Festival.

What more can we do? We’ll leave this question open ;-)
