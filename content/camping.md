**_For campers, Paradise City is more than a music festival, it is also a camping experience. Along with a rising sunshine and star-lit night skies, the intimate setting welcomes a fantastic crowd of music lovers._**

We all know there’s nothing better than having a refreshing (hot) shower followed by a good coffee and a super breakfast, while listening to that guy who was playing piano – remember last year? – or maybe you were the one that woke up, unlocked his sweet little tent and saw his best mates already drinking an opened Carapils can… You took a sip too, kicking off the day. Anyway, you’re feeling ready to start another day of carefully selected electronic music. Our campsite is a true slice of Paradise ;-) And after an intense day of music, get a last and final beer at the camping bar.

As a green festival, our camping will be your personal eco-friendly chill-out area in the midst of festival insanity. We know we can do without a large amount of waste and still partying. There’s a wealth of options to join us onsite, from Camp2Camp or glamping to caravan. Let’s explore them below.
