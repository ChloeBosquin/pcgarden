### **DEAREST CITIZENS,**

#### People make the party, and what a party it was in 2019. Of course, with an increase of popularity comes the challenge of respecting the vibe and comfort of the early days. We realize that you, our earliest supporters, don’t want the festival to become crowdy. But rest assured, the vibe & energy remain our primary focus, not the numbers.

We build our festival for you, to create intense moments, memories for life, like the goosebumps when hearing your favorite tune for the first time, the rush when feeling connected with the rest of the crowd, or the utter joy that comes along with the camaraderie between likeminded spirits.

We are very proud of this year’s line-up: we will take you on a musical trip that was made for your hearts, not the charts.

Paradise City aims to be part of the transition towards environmental responsibility in our society. Sustainability sits at the core of the Paradise City DNA and like each year we will take additional steps to lower our ecological footprint.

We will increase the comfort at our camping this year, so if you want to enjoy Paradise City to the fullest go for the full camping experience.

The countdown has begun. Let’s come together again at the end of June for 3 days in Paradise.

**One Love**
