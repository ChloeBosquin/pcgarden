- title: 1. Green Energy
  description: Green energy lowers the impact of lighting & music. We encourage everyone
    involved in the festival to be aware of how much energy they use, while measuring,
    monitoring and reporting each year on energy usage. The last 2 editions were powered
    up only by renewable energy & using low consumption lightning on site.

- title: 2. Future Food
  description: Future food consists of 100 % locally sourced & organically grown food
    and ingredients from fair-trade source. Because of meatâ€™s high climate & environmental
    impact, we propose a large range of vegetarian & meat free meals from our food
    providers. Menus are discussed internally in order to offer large & balanced alternatives.
    We also try to adapt food quantity to avoid leftovers.
