  description: Green energy lowers the impact of lighting & music. We encourage everyone
    involved in the festival to be aware of how much energy they use, while measuring,
    monitoring and reporting each year on energy usage. The last 2 editions were powered
    up only by renewable energy & using low consumption lightning on site.
