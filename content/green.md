        Green energy lowers the impact of lighting & music. We encourage
        everyone involved in the festival to be aware of how much energy they
        use, while measuring, monitoring and reporting each year on energy
        usage. The last 2 editions were powered up only by **renewable energy**
        & using low consumption lightning on site.

        Future food  consists of **100 % locally sourced & organically grown
        food** and ingredients from fair-trade source. Because of meat’s high
        climate & environmental impact, we propose a large range of vegetarian &
        **meat free meals** from our food providers. Menus are discussed
        internally in order to offer large & balanced alternatives. We also try
        to adapt food quantity to avoid leftovers.

        Waste Management allows us, with our visitors’ participation, to **sort,
        recycle and compost** our waste. In order to minimize our waste stream,
        we have a “Zero single-used plastic” policy & we provide reusable cups
        for all drinks. We are also trying to implement a **circular economy**
        in regards with the waste generated by the festival.

        Transport modes have the biggest impact on our carbon footprint. So how
        will you get here? We are providing near entrance parking for
        sustainable transport modes **with our bicycle point**. We promote
        **Carpooling** and **Public transports**: the more people share a car or
        public transport, the lower the carbon footprint per passenger, the
        lower the carbon footprint per festival resident.

        Filtered tap water is available to avoid a wave of plastic water bottles
        which usually submerges festivals. Meet our less lucrative but more
        responsible alternative: **Paradise City still & sparkling Tap Water.**

        Sustainable communication is considered whenever applicable: we use only
        FSC paper for all our communication on paper (flyers, posters …), which
        we try to cut down. And no tokens, it’s a cashless festival. As for our
        internet site, we make sure it is the lightest possible to avoid any
        negative environmental impact.

        Water is a valuable good of nature that is spread on festival ground as
        our visitors must rehydrate, eat and (optionally) shower. For a second
        year in a row, we intent to **purify on site** the water used in our
        showers, reducing treatment as much as possible. And with the use of our
        **eco-toilets**, we intent to reduce any excessive water usage.

        A CO2-Neutral festival is a goal we have achieved year after year. We
        are aware that even after all our efforts, there is a remaining climate
        impact. Taking our responsibility, we **offset** the unavoidable climate
        impact through the support of CO2logic’s climate project.

        Camping has always been an ecological issue for festivals, mainly
        regarding all the waste left over. We have been working on the problem
        since our first edition and will implement for the second time in a row
        our circular camping where each camper has the opportunity to rent
        recycled camping gear, how cool is that?

        Awareness of the importance of a sustainable way of life is enhanced and
        communicated to our suppliers, partners and sponsors, to assure they
        share our concerns about a **greener future**. And we give you useful
        sustainable tips on the site of the festival.
